           I Think I'm studing more then 3 schools, and my school days life journey is comming below:</p>

           <h2><ins>About </ins> :</h2>

           <p><strong>School:</strong> I'm start my school journey in the year 2005 in the class of <small>LKG</small> from (<i>Nethaji Nursery and Primary School Vazhudavur Villupuram.</i>)

           So I will join the (<i>Fathima Higher Primary School</i>) in the year of 2007-2011 and continue my studies from 1<sup>st</sup> standard to 4<sup>th</sup> standard. 
           And my Dad got  a job Mumbai, So he decided to move my family again my native place Pakkiripalayam Vazhudavur Villupuram. 
           I will rejoin again my primery school in 2011-2012 to continue my 5<sup>th</sup> standard and successfully completed. Then I'm going to join my 6<sup>th</sup> standard in

           my High school studies in Tamil Medium in the year 2015-2017 because I'm poor in English, Go to join <i>Govt. Higher Secondery School</i> from My home village Pakkiripalayam
           Vazhudavur. Scored in 10th Public exam <mark>433/500</mark> and <mark>86%</mark>. This is a end of my school day life.</p>

           <p><strong>College:</strong> I loved to studing Engineering Degree like (<b>B.E, B.Tech</b>), but I would change my decision for my family situation
           and help to support my father in less days. My father is a Crane Mechanic, he have health issue so i decided to quickly complete my studies and help him,
           So I choose <b>Diplome in Electronics and Communication Engineering</b> in 3 years program 2017-2020 
           from <i>Sri Manakula Vinayagar Polytechnic College</i> Madagedipet Puducherry. This I would be Participated a <em>Peper Presentation</em> about a topic

           In this Time My friend says to me an software company was hiring without a degree, they hiring only 12<sup>th</sup> and Diploma holders, I ask him
           Who they are? He told me <b>ZOHO Schools</b> of Learning from <ins>ZOHO Corporation</ins> in Chennai. I would attend the interview for <ins>School
           of Design</ins>, it but unfortunatly I'm not  sellected. Then I would successfully completed my diploma program without any backlogs with an <mark>1<sup>st</sup> class</mark>

         <li><p>Once the Training period complete I'm going to search my next job but it is very difficult to find a new job. I would visit most of the companies
         in Pondicherry. I don't attend any interview because every companies sequrities are told me they don't hire so give me your resume and leave know.
         It's hurts me, but I don't quit to search a job and contginue to keep searching. Finally I don't get a core related jobs so I'm going to join some other
